    <h1> Gà Phở </h1>

    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p>
        Aside from bánh mì, phở is the other smash hit that put Vietnamese cuisine on
        the map in America and around the globe. It’s a humble soup that uses
        affordable ingredients and turns them into a flavorful and aromatic food staple.
        This is something I grew up eating as a kid at home, and at the phở restaurant my 
        parents owned. After moving out I visited many phở restaurants, but only a few that 
        specialize in chicken (phở gà) in Little Saigon, but nothing beats a customized home 
        chicken phở recipe and being reminded of mom’s cooking.
        At my parent’s restaurant, and I bet the same holds true at other ones, quality is 
        sacrificed for commercial viability; This could mean using less chicken and more 
        MSG to boost flavor. This is why I’m unlikely to ever find phở gà that tastes 
        better than momma’s homemade recipe here.
