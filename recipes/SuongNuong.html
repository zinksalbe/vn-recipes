    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> This quintessential rice dish of Vietnamese pork chops is packed with flavor, 
        super easy to make, and a crowd pleaser!
        The marinade adds a ton of garlicky, lemongrassy flavor that pairs great with 
        the pork chops. Grilling adds an amazing aroma and sear, and as if the chops aren’t flavorful enough, they’re topped with scallions & oil.
        It comes with veggies and a lil’ bowl of dipping fish sauce on the side which goes great with Sambal Oelek (my choice!) or fresh chilies if you prefer.
        These chops are something I used to eat all the time during late night food outings and it’s a dish that was the bulk of what Mom 
        sold at her restaurant–so you bet I got some tips from her on this recipe!
