    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p>
        Nothing heals the body, mind, and soul like a steamy bowl of chicken soup even
        if you aren’t under the weather. Vietnamese cháo gà is another delicious take on chicken soup with rice that can feed a large group a delicious meal at a very low cost.
        This is a dish I ate allll the time growing up at home and at Chinese restaurants. And on a recent trip to Vietnam just before the world shut down, we had Vietnamese rice porridge at every single hotel breakfast.
        Oddly, it was the safest and most predictable offering at the hotels, with lots of add-ins that varied depending on the hotel. There are many ways to dress up this chicken rice porridge, but at the core of it, it’s chicken, rice, onion, and ginger. And it’s extremely simple and way better when made at home too in my opinion :).
