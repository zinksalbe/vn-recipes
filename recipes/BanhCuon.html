    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p>
        Bánh cuốn alwats gets me more EXCITED than anyone I know. Trust me there’s something really fun about polishing a plate of these.
        Perhaps its the little individual rolls and unlimited combination of sides you can do that make each bite fun to craft and slightly different from the last. But any way you combine them it’s delicious for sure.
        Nothing beats the freshly steamed rice wrappers–they have a warmth and delicate chew you want to enjoy quickly. The filling of pork and veggies gives a burst of flavor. You’ll always find a fresh mound of bean sprouts, herbs and other sides, all meant to be dipped or drizzled in a prepared fish sauce.
        So like any freshly baked or steamed cake, due to its fleeting freshness window, these are best enjoyed fresh off the steamer, and nothing cuts that window down like homemade bánh cuốn. And at home you can tailor the filling, sides, and dipping sauce just how you want. Read on to learn how my favorite way to eat these.
